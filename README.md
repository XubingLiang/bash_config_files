# Bash Configuration Files

## Instructions

Open terminal and git clone to the home directory, or download and extract to a folder in the home directory.

Afterwards, run setup.sh to make a bunch of symbolic links from the home directory ~ to the folder
containing the git repo. By creating symlinks, this ensures that the dotconfig files can be updated using git.

Warning: running setup.sh will delete any dotconfig files and replace them with symlinks to the local git directory!
